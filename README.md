# Employee Payroll Tracker

## Descirption
This weeks challenge revolved around JavaScript. My challange was to create a basic pay roll tracker for employees that are to be entered by the user with a given salary. The Pay roll tracker then asks the user if they would like to add another employee or cancel. From here the tracker will list the given names of employees sorted in alphabetical order by last name.

Once the console log is open you will find there will a table if 4 or more employees are entered, it will also pick a random employee as a prize winner and calculate the overall average salary.

## User Story
AS A payroll manager
I WANT AN employee payroll tracker
SO THAT I can see my employees' payroll data and properly budget for the company

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN an employee payroll tracker
WHEN I click the "Add employee" button
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts asking for first name, last name, and salary
WHEN I finish adding an employee
THEN I am prompted to continue or cancel
WHEN I choose to continue
THEN I am prompted to add a new employee
WHEN I choose to cancel
THEN my employee data is displayed on the page sorted alphabetically by last name, and the console shows computed and aggregated data
